\description{
Implements the Functional Data Spatial Clustering with Outlier Detection 
and Minimum Spanning Tree optimization (FDSCOD-MST) algorithm.
This function performs clustering on functional spatial data while detecting 
potential outliers. It first applies preliminary outlier screening based on 
statistical testing, then fits B-spline basis functions to the functional data, 
optimizes the regularization parameter via BIC, and constructs a Minimum 
Spanning Tree to refine clustering assignments. The output includes the 
estimated cluster memberships, the number of detected groups, and the indices 
of identified outliers.
